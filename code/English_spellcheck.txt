Do you want to clear the runner and club databases?
Some classes contain requests for a common start time for some competitors. Do you wish to convert these classes to patrol classes?
There exist runners with result for this course. If you use the first control as start, the start times will be overwritten.

Do you wish to continue?
There are still vacancies.

Do you wish to remove all vacancies before exporting results?
A competition (X) with the same origin already exist. You can import the competition as a version of that competition or as a new independent copy. If it is the same event with modifications, it is best to import it as a version.

Would you like to import it as a version?
When you start a result kiosk, you put MeOS in a mode where it is only possible to show result reports. No other operations are permitted until the program is restarted. If there is an active SI device connected to the computer, MeOS will automatically show results for the last read card.

You should consider protecting the database with a password, if you publicly expose a result kiosk.

Do you wish to start a result kiosk?
Do you wish to restore previously saved windows on this computer?
Some classes (X) have no course.

MeOS use the courses when drawing to avoid that runners with the same first controls start at the same time.

Do you wish to proceed anyway?
Out of maps. Do you want to add this competitor anyway?
The competition is already on server. Do you want to overwrite the competition on the server?
You have chosen to overwrite the competition. Make sure no one else is connected.

Do you wish to proceed?
X already has a result. Do you want to overwrite it?
Results are lost if you remove the scheme. Do you wish to continue?
Repair the database only if you experience problems.

Important:
- Make sure no one else is connected to the database.
- If the server crashes or goes down while repairing, you must restart it and retry the repair before doing anything else. If you make any other operation with the database all data will be lost.

Do you wish to try a repair operation now?
Do you wish to save current class and window settings on this computer?
Carry out a simulation with the settings you have made (classes, starting depth, distance, rules) and with the registered participants who are in the classes. The competition is not affected. The result shows whether it is reasonable that everyone has time to start within the set start depth and how long extra waiting time to start may be required in different classes.

Afterwards, you can also save a copy of the competition with simulated start times to study e.g. minute start list.

Do you want to run the simulation?
If you start a start time reservation kiosk, MeOS enters a state where no other operations are supported or settings can be changed. You need a connected and activated SI unit.

You should consider password protecting the database if you are exposing a kiosk.

Do you want to start the kiosk mode?
Lengths of individual course legs may require an update after this change.

Do you wish fix that now?
Do you wish to keep all currently assigned start times, if possible? Answer no to move the competition in time.
The course is not used by any other competitor in this class.

Would you like to use it anyway?

A service in MeOS is a small program that automatically does something every now and then or when the competition data is changed.
Select a class to merge with this class. If start times are drawn you might want to draw again, since the runners keep their start times.
The competition is created by another version of MeOS and cannot be opened from a server. You can however import the competition from file.
This operation removes the club you have chosen (%s, id=%d) and moves all runners of that club to the new club you choose below. The operation cannot be undone.
Add controls by adding a sequence of control numbers (control id numbers). You need not specify the finish. Example: 31, 50, 36, 50, 37, 100.
The TCP port is used for receiving punches over TCP from other systems. Specify the port used. The zero time of the protocol is 00:00:00.
A list with read card is shown. To tie a runner to another card, double click the card or runner you wish to move.
You can extend MeOS knowledge of runners, clubs and classes by searching databases in MeOS format or the IOF (xml) format.

Do you wish to proceed?
Input control number, runner (start number or card number) and clock time (HH:MM:SS). You may leave the time field blank; then the computer clock is used. Press <Enter> to save.
You can export settings, club and runner databases to a specified folder. These settings and databases can be imported to another computer.
If you make a mistake, click the runners name to change the entry. Use the page runners to remove entries. To see a class in the list below, it must be marked for quick entry on the page classes.
Here you define your courses. A course is then tied to one or more classes (or runners). It is also possible to import courses from OCAD, Condes, or other course software. If you specify the number of maps, MeOS will keep track of available maps in the quick entry form.
A course pool is used for defining a pool of courses for a leg. The course is tied to the runner on finish by control matching. Define courses in the pool by adding them under Several Courses / Relay. An [S] after the class means that all its competitors have a start time.
You can install settings, clubs and runner database from a specified source folder. Your local settings are overwritten. MeOS might be restarted after the installation.

The button <Export> takes you to a page where instead you can export your current settings.
Here you manage clubs and print invoices. You can assign competition fees based on class type and entry date. Duplicated (misspelled) clubs can be merged with the corresponding correct club. You can also update club addresses from the registry.
You can create many different sorts of lists and reports. These can be shown on screen, printed, or saved in web format. The list is automatically updated when competition data is changed. Automatic result printing is done on the page Services. To export competition data, for example split times, go to the page Competition.
A restart is defined by a rope time and a restart time. At the rope time, the changeover is closed and no competitors are let out into the forest. The remaining runners start at the rope time. It is possible to specify different times for individual legs, but by using this function you can quickly handle whole classes.
Import entries in free text format. Specify name, club, class, and card number (possibly also start time), preferably separated by comma, one person (team) per row. It is also possible to specify many competitors in the same club / class by partly leaving out these fields. It is also possible to import data formatted in other ways.
Select a punch from the list to change or remove it. You can add missing punches from the course template. If the finish time is missing, the runner gets status <Did Not Finish>. If a punch is missing, the status is <Missing Punch>. It is not possible to assign a status incompatible with the punches. If there is a finish punch, you must modify it to set a manual finish time. The same principle applies for the start punch.
Enter a first start time and start interval. Draw random gives an unconditionally random start order. Swedish draw method uses special rules to distribute runners from the same club. Clumped start means the whole class starts in small groups during the specified interval (extended mass start).  In the field leg, you can specify which leg is to be drawn, if the class has several.
You can handle runners that didn't start automatically by reading out SI stations (clear/check/start/controls) in SportIdent Config+. Save the readout as a semi colon separated text file and import this file into MeOS. Runners in this import get a registration. Then you can give DNS status to all runners without registration. If you later import more runners, you can reset the status (from DNS to Unknown) on the runners now imported.
You are now connected to a server. To open a competition on the server, select it in the list and click open. Do add a competition to the server, open the competition locally and select upload. When you have opened a competition on the server, you will see all other connected MeOS clients.
Connect to a server below.

Installation
Download and install MySQL (Community Edition) from www.mysql.com. You can use default settings. It is only necessary to install MySQL on the computer acting server. When MySQL is installed, start MySQL Command Line Client and create a user account for MeOS. You write like this:

> CREATE USER meos;
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO meos;

You have now created a user meos with no password. Enter the name of the server below (you may have to configure firewalls to let through the traffic).

As an alternative you can use the built-in root account of MySQL. User name is 'root' and password is the one you provided when installing MySQL.
Found no SI unit. Are they connected and started?
In this form, you can quickly make basic settings for many classes in one step.

Start is the name of the start as it is printed in the start list.

Block is a number between 0 and 100 which can provide an even finer distribution of runners. Classes in the same block will be printed on the same minute start list. 

Index is a sorting key. The classes are sorted by this key in all lists.

The course can be specified for classes which have exactly one course; if there are several possible courses you need to use the standard class form.

Quick entry determines if the class supports quick entry mode, i.e., is a possible choice in the quick entry class list.
The class fees, which shows if you have activated Economy features, are used for new entries. If you change a fee, MeOS will ask if you wish to apply the change to existing competitors.

For bibs you have the options None, Consecutive and Manual. You can also type the first bib in the class, for example A100, or 50. Consecutive means that the last number of the preceding class is used to define the first number in this class. Reserved bib numbers give a gap (of the specified width) in the numbering between classes.

MeOS updates bibs when you draw start times or change the settings. Manual means that MeOS will never automatically update bibs.

For classes with teams the setting Team member controls the relation between the team number and the bibs. It can be the same, increasing (100, 101, 102), leg dependent (100-1, 100-2, etc.) or completely independent.
The number of runners in a team is specified on the page Classes.
Interval (seconds). Leave the field blank to update when the competition is changed.
For every control, you specify one or more code number (SI codes). In a course, you refer to the control by its ID number. Usually, you do not need to add controls manually, since MeOS automatically adds all controls needed.

More than one SI code is useful for replacing malfunctioning controls or to create simple forks. For an ordinary control, it is required that the runner visit on of the specified controls. If the control status is <Multiple>, all specified controls must be visited (in any order). If the status is <Bad>, the control is ignored.

The status <Lost> works like <Bad>, but in addition the running time to the next control is ignored; it does not matter for the final time how much time was spent looking for the lost control.

If you specify a control name, it is possible to print result lists with intermediate times at named controls.

Time adjustment can be used if it turns out that a control has wrong time. Time format is +/-MM:SS or +/-HH:MM:SS.

Shortest leg time defines the shortest possible time on that leg. No runner will get a shorter time to this control, no matter how fast he/she is. This can be used, for example, if a dangerous road must be crossed.

Status <No timing> means that the time to the control is ignored; the total time will be the same no matter what the actual time to this control is.
Provide one or more control numbers (SI codes) used by this control.
Example: 31, 250.
Received no answer. Do you want to open the port in passive mode; should MeOS listen to incoming punches?
- If there is no course, the status is set to OK on finish punch.

- If there is a course, radio punches are used as controls. No card readout is necessary.
MeOS will not update assignment to a locked class even if qualification results are altered.
This function allows you to print out card data without using any competition, much like a standalone printing unit. Select Print Splits to select and configure the printer.

The cards are also saved in memory (but not in the competition). You can edit name and club for a card by clicking the name (Or 'Unknown'). You can also save the cards to file (Save) or create a new competition from card data. Note that if a competition is currently open, you must close it to make this option available.
Create and appoint (temporary) team members for all teams, to whom you can assign SI Card, Course etc.
MeOS will take care of entry fees for you automatically in many cases. The competitors are assigned fees based on age and entry date (you define the limits under Competition Settings). Every class defines its fees. You provide default values for different class types under Competition Settings, but you can also manually change class settings using Quick Settings for the class.

This page lets you manually use different ages and time limits for different fees. On the page competitor, you can manually adjust the fee for individual competitors, if needed.
This function computes an optimal forking pattern from selected courses. Assign one or more courses to the legs by selecting courses and legs from the lists above. All courses can have the same set of courses (equal forking) or it i possible to use different set of courses for different legs. Also in this case, MeOS will fork these courses against each other, if the courses allow it.
Transmission speed/Baud rate: use 4800 or 38400.
You can handle bibs automatically or manually. Here you can assign bibs manually for a certain class by specifying the method Manual and provide the first number in the class.

The method automatic works in the same way, with the difference that MeOS will update the bibs of all classes at once. Although it is possible to make this setting here, it is better to use the Quick settings for classes to get an overview over all classes.

Use the method Automatic together with the methods None or Consecutive, which means that the last number in the preceding class is used as first number. The number of reserved bibs specifies the jump made in the numbering between classes.

For team classes you can specify how the competitors´ bibs relate to the team´s bib. It can be the Same, Independent, Increasing (Team 1: 101, 102, 103, 104, Team 2: 111, 112, 113, 114 etc) or Leg (100-1, 100-2, 100-3 etc).
Use this function to count and tick off hired cards to check that they all have been returned. Attach a SI unit (preferably programmed as a control or finish, since that is faster than card read out), and punch all returned cards. Push the Report button to see if any card is missing.

 The check is done locally at this computer, and does not modify the competition.
An incoming punch is matched against a start number and plays the file <N.wav>, where N is the start number. The files are located in the folder below. If the runner/team belongs has nationality NAT, MeOS first tries to play the file <NAT/N.wav>, which should contain the number in an appropriate language version.
You can insert custom specific data by typing [Symbol Name]. Available symbols can be seen in the list to the right.

 Example: Well done [RunnerName]!
The runner database is older than two months. Do you wish to download a new database from Eventor?
Make a local copy of this competition.
Type your club's Eventor (Sweden) API key. You get the key from your club's Eventor administrator.
You can export a spreadsheet in csv format, containing classes, number of competitors, and draw settings for each class. It is then possible to edit the start data and then import it back into MeOS to draw the classes accordingly.
You can adjust the scroll speed using Ctrl+M (increase) and Ctrl+N (decrease) on your keyboard. To escape full screen mode, press Esc.
You can import runners, classes, clubs and entries from a number of different text and XML formats. It is not necessary to provide all files below. For example, an OE-CSV file with entries contains clubs and classes, so in that case these fields should be left empty.

If the same runner is imported several times, you will not get several copies of the runner. Instead, the entry is updated. This means that it is harmless to re-import or import an extended file with entries.
You can import courses and classes from (for example) an OCAD or Condes export.
This method starts a timer in full screen mode (large-screen) when a competitor in a selected class punches the <From> control, and measures the time until the <To> control is reached. Otherwise, a top list with the best results is shown. Both controls need of course be online controls and if you use a network, make sure to activate <fast advance information on control punches> to get a responsive timer.
Competition date is the date when all classes start. Zero time is at midnight.
It is possible to merge competitions and results, provided that they are based on the same set of courses and controls. Different groups of participants can complete the competition on different occasions and then the different competitions can be merged into one competition with a common list of results. Another possibility is to have different locations for different classes. If it is not possible to set up a common network, you can periodically exchange competition files to incorporate changes.

1. Prepare the whole competition.
2. Save a copy and import it to the outsourced computers (or local area networks).
3. To transfer changes, export the contest from the outsourced computer (or computers) and merge it with this feature. Then export a copy from the main computer and make the corresponding import on the outsourced computers. 
4. The procedure can be repeated several times to continuously transfer the results.

Note: If you make changes to (for example) the same participant in several places, some of the changes will be overwritten without warning. Make sure that each outsourced place only changes in its part of the competition.

Tip: Make a transfer as soon as the outsourced competitions have started before any change has been made, to test that everything has been set up correctly.
If you have access to the courses (for example, from OCAD or Condes) you can provide the name of the course file here. Otherwise, you may add courses later.
The service is used to receive radio punches from the Internet, for example a radio control connected via a mobile phone. It is also possible to construct a simple web form, where you can manually enter the bib number of runners as the pass by.

The service protocol also supports other types of data entry, such as team line-up, direct entries, card changes etc. If you want to develop you own services, you can find documentation and examples on MeOS web site: www.melin.nu/meos.
The service is used to automatically send results and start lists to the Internet for immediate publication in some form. You need to make settings adapted to the remote service you want to user: the provider of the remote service can give you necessary details.

If you want to develop you own services, you can find documentation and examples on MeOS web site: www.melin.nu/meos.
You can define custom modes of payment, in addition to invoicing, to distinguish these in the bookkeeping.
Preregister punching cards as rental cards to get automatic hired card status when the card is assigned.
Use the guide below to choose between a number of predefined competition forms. After you apply the settings, it is possible to manually adapt the settings for each leg and setup courses.

Some explanations:
- Relay is used for different kinds of relays.
- Two-runner relay means that two runners make a team and take turns running.
- Co-runner relay is sometimes used in youth classes and allow for more than one runner on some legs. (The first runner changes over).
- A patrol race can be run with one or two punching cards.
- Prologue + pursuit is individual, but with two races.
- Course pool means there are several course variants, but that it is not decided in advance who runs which course; it is decided automatically when the runner finishes.
Requesting start time is something in between free and drawn start time. By requesting a start time, MeOS ensures that there is a certain distance between participants in the same class or on the same course. If you have a requested start time, it is not necessary to use a start punch.

Set parameters for start depth and how many/who are allowed to start at the same time. How far it is from the place where the booking is made to the start determines what is an appropriate minimum time to start value.

You can let the participants automatically get the first possible available start time after the minimum time to start, or let them choose from a number possible start times. It is possible and appropriate to print out a start certificate to take with you to the start.

If you are using a live results service, the start time will probably be displayed there when booked.
MeOS REST API lets you access competition data via a web connection. You can show result lists directly in a web browser, but you can also request competition data and results in an XML format, suitable for further processing in third party programs and apps.
Choose a backup to restore by clicking the time when the backup was created.
By importing a runner and club database, MeOS will automatically recognize unknown runners (by card number), and you will get addresses and phone numbers to clubs. 
MeOS automatically saves all settings when needed.
Seeded start time allocation means that an earlier result or ranking controls the process in part. In the field seeding groups you may either enter a single group size, meaning that the entire class is partitioned into groups of this size. The group size "1" means that the seeding order is strictly used. You can also specify several group sizes. "15, 1000" would mean a seeded group with the 15 highest ranked runners and the remaining (at most 1000) runners are placed in a non-seeded group.
Select sounds to play. By default, MeOS built-in sounds are played.
This service lets you simulate readout of SI cards. Times and punches are generated for all runners. Also radio control punches can be simulated.

WARNING: Use for testing only. If you use this on a real event, it will be corrupted.
Choose which classes and courses you want to watch.
Check those runners/teams you wish to watch from start, and as long as the runner/team is doing well. Put two checks to watch even if the result is not so good. No check means monitoring only if the runner/team is doing well (not from start).
Decide if you want to export total results, or individual results for each race. If you choose to export all races, numbered files will be created.
Starting groups are used to control start list drawing. Competitors in a group will begin starting at the start time of the group.
MeOS will automatically apply the chosen start method. No matter what you choose here, you can always change start method or redraw lists later.
Here you can import team line-ups from a structured text-based format, which is easy to produce manually from a spreadsheet program. The file must have the following format:

Class;Team name;[Club]
Competitor 1;[Card No];[Club];[Course];[Competitor's class]
Competitor 2;[Card No];[Club];[Course];[Competitor's class]
...
Class;Team name;[Club]
...

Fields marked with [] may be excluded. Note that referred classes and courses must exist, and that the number of legs in the class must match the number of competitor rows following the class. Empty rows can be used if there is no competitor. The option <Use competitors already in competition> means that only competitors already in the competition are moved to the team; other competitors specified are ignored.
The runners swap position. You can make a sequence of swaps to reach the new team line-up.
This service saves split times to an IOF (xml) file at regular intervals. If you open this file in WinSplits, the splits there will be updated live.
Set zero time to one hour before first planned start.
Provide a first (ordinary) start time, a least start interval (within a class) and the fraction of vacancies. You can also choose the method use when drawing and if late entries are to start in front of or after the ordinary entries. The first start time must be after the zero time of the competition.

If you click <Automatic Draw>, MeOS will inspect all classes. If the class is not drawn, it will be, if there are late entries without start time in a class, these will be drawn.

MeOS ensures that runners with similar courses do not start simultaneously, and space will be reserved to allow for late entries under the same conditions.

If you instead click <Draw Manually> you will be able to control exactly which classes are drawn and with which parameters.
You draw the start list in a two-step process. First you choose which classes to draw and you make some basic settings. When you press <Distribute Times> MeOS will use your settings to distribute start time slots between classes. MeOS ensures that classes with similar courses do not start at the same time, taking already drawn classes into account. A goal is an even distribution of starters.

The calculated distribution is presented in a table, where you can make your own changes, or let MeOS update its distribution, taking your changes into account. When you are happy with the distribution, you let MeOS draw the selected classes.

The basic settings you have to make is to provide a first allowed time to start and a smallest allowed interval. The maximal number of parallel starts determines how many runners can start at the same time. An increased value gives a shorter start depth.

The fraction of vacant positions controls the number of vacant positions. If you need no vacancies, type 0%. The expected number of late entries reserves space for these in the start list with a guarantee that no runner starting on the same time will have the same course.
Use a second raised fee for direct entry at the competition day (for example). The higher fee is applied starting from and including the specified day. The specified percentage is relative the original fee.
HTML can be exported as a structured table or as a freely formatted document (more similar to the MeOS lists). You can also use export templates for custom formatting: columns, JavaScript base page flips, automatic scrolling, etc. It is possible to add custom templates by adding '.template' files in MeOS data folder. If you use a template there is a number of parameters to set below. The exact interpretation depends on the template.

If you select <Store Settings> the list and its settings is stored permanently in the competition. You can then access the list by using MeOS as a web server (The service 'Information Server') or export the list automatically at regular intervals.
Starting the service for instant result transfer failed. Results will be received with a few seconds delay. This is expected behavior if more than one MeOS process is started on this computer.
You can use a custom list for the split printout. Design the list and use the function 'For Split Times' in the list editor to make changes for split printout.

You can control the list to use per class by using the table mode.
MeOS is unable to determine what function a unit has unless it is directly attached to the computer. Therefore the programmed punch code is used to determine the type. You can control the interpretation below. Numbers higher than 30 are always interpreted as controls.

Be careful when using start punches; they may permanently overwrite the drawn starting time.
To handle more than one stage you must work locally. Save a copy of the competition, open it locally and transfer results to the next stage. Then upload the next stage to the server.
A competitor may do multiple starts with the same card. Automatic new entry for each readout.
Cannot load the specified list.

Using defaults instead.
If you import entries and classes from different sources to the same competition, it might happen that there are clashes in the Id numbers of the classes. To separate the classes, you may enter an offset for the Class Id when working with files from a particular source; this will be added to the Id numbers.

You must specify the same offset each time you import from that source.

 A suitable number could be 1000 (which will work as long as every Id is less that 1000).
Show the list one page at the time, with the specified number of columns. Automatically reload data for each round.

Activate the SI unit by selecting its COM-port, or by searching for installed SI units. Press Information to get status for the selected port.

Interactive readout lets you directly handle problems, such as wrong card number. Do not use this option when runners with problems are handled separately.

The runner database is used if you want to automatically add new runners. The punches are used to find (guess) the right class.
Lock the function to prevent accidental changes.

Sound selection lets you enable sound signals to be played back on reading out a card.

Open Readout Window shows a new window designed to be shown on a screen turned towards the competitor, showing information about the last readout.

Multiple races per competitor can be used if you are allowed do several attempts on the course. A new entry is created for each readout.
The readout window shows information on the latest card readout.
Since you are connected to a server, it is not possible to edit the club and runner databases manually. Make changes before uploading the competition to a server. It is also possible to replace the existing database on the server by importing a new database (from IOF XML).
The imported file contains forking data for teams. To import this data, you must prepare the competition to match the imported file: 

1. Ensure all classes are setup with the correct number of legs.
2. Provide bib numbers in each class. Use Quick Settings on the page Classes and enter the first bib number in each class (meaning automatic bib setting). You can also import the teams first and assign bibs as usual.
3. Import the courses. You can import this file several times if needed to update the forking.
Select an existing course that shortens the current course. Several levels of shortening are possible.
No competitors seem to be in the forest. Since the data behind this conclusion might be incorrect, you should verify that no runner is left in the forest by other means.

Changing the zero time for a competition with results is not recommended.

Do you wish to proceed anyway?
The field External Id is usually used to match entities with other databases (such as entry, result, or economy systems). If you make incompatible changes, various and hard-to-understand problems might arise.
Using start times more than X hours after the zero time is not recommended, since older SI cards only has a 12-hour clock.

Do you wish to proceed anyway?
X competitors are still missing results and are therefore excluded.

You should manage competitors in forest to assign status <DNS> to remaining runners.
